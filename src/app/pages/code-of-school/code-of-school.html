            Don't believe us, picture your average day: You wake up to the alarm on your smart phone that recognizes your sleep patterns, your light turns on simultaneously (it is linked to the alarm, of course). You reach out for your phone and ask it to read out your emails and then play some soft jazz over blutooth speakers as you get ready to take on the day. This is 5 minutes in to your day; start thinking about how much our lives are driven by technology from the maps you use, to the smart television to the fridge that tells you your running low on milk to thermostat that adjusts your room temperature to the device that drops your dog a treat when you are 500 kms away, all with the tap of a button. Code makes all this possible. <br> <br> This is why equipping your child with coding skills is no longer an option but an essential in his/her skill set. Which is why we want you to learn code with us. It's simple and all it requires is a dose of logic.
